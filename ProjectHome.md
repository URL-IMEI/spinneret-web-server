This is the code repository and issue tracker for Propeller objects and files that can be used with the Spinneret Web Server, which is an open-source hardware design from Parallax.

The Spinneret Web Server is an Ethernet based development board for the Propeller microcontroller. Web page content, files, and logs can be stored on a MicroSD card. The serial EEPROM has 32 KB for storing a Propeller program and 32 KB for non-volatile data storage, independent of the MicroSD card. There is a real-time clock controller for time stamping files and events and a backup capacitor that will keep the clock running through extended power outages. There is a serial programming header and two auxiliary I/O connections, one for level-shifted open collector communications over a three-pin data/power/ground cable, and a the second is a 12-pin socket for direct 3.3 volt I/O connections. There are eight status LEDs on the PCB, plus two that are repeated on the Ethernet jack. One of the status LEDs is user controllable and shares a line with a button that can be read under user control. A second button resets the Propeller to reload the firmware from the EEPROM.

The hardware and firmware are both released under open-source licenses.  For more information about the hardware, see the links section to the right.
